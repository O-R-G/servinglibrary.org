+ paypal button behavior was erratic, extensively debugged using 

	* http://servinglibrary.org/journal/4
 
  two issues:

  + old button ids do not correspond to current paypal button ids
    (this seems to have no consequence however)
  + paypal acct settings updated to not block if in GBP or EUR

  the actual issue is a browser cookie that paypal sets per currency
  confirmed by using using safari private windows, and each time
  the first currency add to cart button works fine but the others fail
